## ACCY 301 Notes

### Day 1 & 2 Notes  [Environment and Theoretical structure of finanical accounting]

##### Economic theory of information
- The economic goal of a society is to maximize wealth.

  - For that to happen, resources (e.g. labor, capital, natural resources) must be allocated efficiently (allocated to private enterprises that will use them best to provide the goods and services desired by society, and not to enterprises that will waste them): allocation efficiency.


- The capital markets provide a mechanism (supply and demand) to help our economy allocate resources efficiently.
  - examples of capital markets: Stock market; bond markets; etc.


- Markets need information to function and allocate resources.
  - Markets need macroeconomic information: interest rates, exchange rates, GDP growth, employment
  - industry specific information: number of firms, industry leadership, level of competition
  - firm-specific information: financial condition, revenue growth, profitability. **Finanical account provides the firm-specific information.**


##### The Economic Environment and Finanical Reporting

- Capital is wealth in the form of money or other assets.

- Firms acquire capital from investors in exchange for ownership interest and by borrowing from creditors (loans & bonds).


- A firm can provide a positive return to investors if the entity can generate enough cash recipets from selling a product or service that exeed the cash disbursesments necessary to provide that product or service.


- The primary objective of financial accounting is to provide informtion to investors and creditors to help them predict future cash flows.

- The information provided through financial accounting is conveyed through:

  - Balance Sheet or statement of financial position:  The broad usefulness of the balance sheet is to indicate how the assets of the firm were financed.

  - Income statement or statement of operations: The broad usefulness of the income statement is to indicate the Value Added by the operating activites of the firm over  specific period.

  - Statement of cash flows:  The purpose of the statement of cash flows (SCF) is to provide information about cash receipts and cash disbursements that occurred during a period (it reports flows of value). A SCF is presented for each period in which results of operations are provided.

  - Statement of shareholders' equity:  The statement of shareholders' equity is a financial document a company issues as part of its balance sheet. It highlights the changes in value to stockholders' or shareholders' equity, or ownership interest in a company, from the beginning of a given accounting period to the end of that period.

  - Either:

    - Statement of other comprehensive income:  imeediately following the income statement

    - Statement of comprehensive income including info on the income statement as well as on the atatement of other comprehensive income

    - Comprehensive income is the total change in equity for a reporting period other than that from transactions with owners.


##### Cash versus accural accounting

- Over short periods of time, recording only cash flow is not accurate. The accural accounting model records both cash flows and accruals and provides a measure of periodic performance called **net income**.

- **net income is a product of using accural accounting. net income =  income -  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) - expenses - taxes

- **current net operating cash flows** is a product from cash accounting

- Net income is considered a better indicator of future operating cash flows than current net operating cash flows.


##### Why is accounting regulated

- When companies use the same rules to do the accounting, the users of the finanical statements can compare financial information over time for a company and among companies.


##### The Conceptual Framework

- The purpose of the conceptual framework is to provide an underlying foundation for accounting standards.

- Conceptual Framework: ![./ACCY301_notes/imgs/cFrameWork.png](./ACCY301_notes/imgs/cFrameWork.png)


- Recall the objective is to provide financial info that is useful to people who proivde capital.

- Qualitative Characteristics of accounting information:
  - **Relevance:** Should be relevant such that the elements have predictive value; can be confirmed  and they are material (or note-worthy). i.e a piece of information about $5 revenue is not material for a company like apple.

  - **Faithful Representation:** The info provided is complete. This is necessary for faithful representation. Accounting standards used should be set with overall societalgoals and specific objectives in mind, and should try not to favor particular groups or companies. Should be free from error. Verification should be required of the information. i.e greater verification before recognizing good news than bad news

  - **Enhancing:** The info provided should help users of the info see the similarities and diffs among events and conditions. Users must be able to understand the information.

  - **KEY CONSTAINT:** cost effectiveness. The benefit of the information provided must exceed the costs of producing the information

- Recognition and Measurement Concepts:
  - Assumptions:
    - Economic Entity Assumption: All economic events can be identified with a particular economic entity

    - Going Concern Assumption: In the absence of information to the contrary, it is anticipated that a business entity will continue to operate indefinitely.

    - Periodicity Assumption: The life of a company can be divided into artifical time periods to provide timely information to external Users.

    - Monetary Unity Assumption: Finanical statement elements should be measured in terms of the USD.

  - Principles:
    - Revenue recognition: revenue is recognixed when the seller transfers goods and services to customers but does not allow revenue exognition if it is not probable that the seller will receive the cash it is entitled to receive.

    - Expense recognition: typically pccurs in the period in which expenses are incurred to produce revenue.
      - Mathcing Principle requires first recognizing revnue and then recognizing all expenses that were iccurred to generate that revnue.

    - Measurement - assoicating numerical amount to assets, liabilities, equity.
      - There are 5 measurements:
        - Historical Cost: amount given or recieved in the original exchange transactions
        - Net realizable value: amount of cash into which the asset or liability will be converted in the ordinary course of business
        -  Current cost: the cost that would be inccurred to purchase or reproduce an assets- resent value: future cash flows discounted for the time value of Monetary
        - Fair value: the price that would be recieved to sell assets or transfer liabilites in an orderly market transaction.

    - Disclosure -  financial reports should include any info that could affect the decisions made by external users, subject to of course the cost effectiveness constraint.

- elements (I find Theo's defintions a bit diffcult to remember so I paraphrase the following or use alternative defintions):

  - Assets: An entity's resources i.e things a company owns.
  - liabilites: An entity's obligations. i.e the amounds the company owes.
  - Equity: an ownership interest in a business,
  - Investments by owners: Increases in equity of a particular business enterprise
  - Distribution to ownerss: Decrease in equity of a particular enterprise resulting from transfers to owners
  - Comprehensive income: The change in equity during a period from transactions and other events  from nonowner sources.
  - Revenues: Inflows, increases  in assets, or settlements of liabilities.
  - Expenses: Outflows, decreases in assets, or incurrences of liabilities.
  - Gains: Increases in Equity
  - Losses: Decreases in Equity


### Day 3 Notes: [Review of the accounting process]


##### The Accounting processing cycle

1. Obtain info about transactions from source documents (recipts, notes, etc.)

2. Perform transaction analysis where you review the source documents from Step 1 and determine the economic implications of the transactions

3. Record the transaction in a journal using a journal entry where debits will always equal credits.
  - a journal is a chronological list of transactions in debit/credit form.

4. You then post from the journal to the general ledger accounts.
  -  A general ledger contains a complete record of all the financial transactions of your company throughout its life.

5. Prepare an unadjusted trial balance.
  - An unadjusted trail balance is the listing of general ledger account balances at the end of a reporting period, before any adjusting entries are made to the balances to create financial statements

6. Record the adjusting entries and add those changes tp the ledger accounts

7. Prepare an adjusted trail balance

8. Prepare financial statements
  - i.e: balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, and statement other comprehensive Income

9. Close the temporary accounts (all income statement accounts)

10. Prepare a post-closing trail balance.

- Accounting Equation: Assets = Liabilites + Shareholder's Equity

  - Shareholders Equity = Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings
    - Revenues & Gains increase Retained Earnings
    - Expenses, Losses, & Dividends decrease retained earnings.

- Prepaid expenses represent assets recorded when a cash disbursement creates benefits beyond the current reporting periods

- Deferred revenues represent liabilities recorded when cash is received from customers before the entity provides them with goods or services.

- Accurals involve transactions where the cash outflow or inflow takes place in a period subsequent to expense or revenue recognition.

- Accuraled liabilites represent liabilites that are recorded when an expense has been inccurred prior to making a cash payment. For example: An entity has to pay it's employees.

- Accured recivables is the opposite of accured liabilites. It involves situations when the revnue is recognized in a period prior being paid.

- Estimates are other made to comply with the accrual accounting model.


### Day 4 [The balance sheet and financial disclosures]

##### The balance sheet (statement of financial position):

- Usefulness: The broad usefulness of the balance sheet is to indicate how the assets of the firm were financed (assets = liabilities + equity).
  - It provides information useful for assessing future cash flows, liquidity, and long-term solvency.

- Limitations: Assets minus liabilities is not likely to represent the market value of the entity (number of common stock shares outstanding multiplied by price per share)


- Assets are:
  - Current Assets: 

  - Long-term Assets:

- Liabilities:
  - Current Liabilities:

  - Non-Current Liabilities:

- Shareholders' Equity:
  - Paid-in capital:

  - Retained Earnings:
